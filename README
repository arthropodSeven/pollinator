##Pollinator

A more modern replacement for the Unicode pseudoalphabet 'translator' at qaz.wtf. Version 1 will
just be a Node library when it's done. After that, I'll add a React frontend and serve it as a
webapp. 

Half my motivation for starting this project is in wanting a faster alternative to qaz.wtf that
I can use from the command line. The other half is about learning to use Flow, putting together
the build process for a modern webapp myself, understanding JavaScript testing and continuous
integration, and so on.
